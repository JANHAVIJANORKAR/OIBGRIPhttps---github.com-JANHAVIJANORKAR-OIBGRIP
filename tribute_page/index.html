        throughout her career. In 1989, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her by the 
        Government of India.[11] In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, 
        she was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour; she is only the second female singer, 
        after M. S. Subbulakshmi, to receive this honour.[12] France conferred on her its highest civilian award, 
        Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, in 2007.[13]
        
        She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 15 Bengal Film Journalists'
         Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, 
         the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. In 1974, she was one of the first

         song was "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti ki" released on 30 March 2019 as a tribute to the Indian 
         Army and the Nation.[14]
        
        At one point, she appeared in the Guinness World Records which listed her as
         the most recorded artist in history between 1948 and 1987.[15]</aside></center>

In 1984, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh instituted the Lata Mangeshkar Award in her honour
. The State Government of Maharashtra also instituted a Lata Mangeshkar Award in 1992.[180]

In 2009, she was awarded the title of Officer of the French Legion of Honour, France's

 of the Greatest Indian since independence.[182]

 ("[she] is never off-key").[183] Dilip Kumar once commented, Lata Mangeshkar ki 
 awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain, meaning "Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God".[184]

She also received honorary doctorates from the Sangeet Natak Akademi in 1989,
 Indira Kala Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya, Khairagarh, and Shivaji University in Kolhapur.[185][186]

Controversy
In 1974, The Guinness Book of Records listed Lata Mangeshkar as the most 
recorded artist in history, stating that she had reportedly recorded "more 
than 25,000 solo, duet and chorus backed songs in 20 Indian languages" between 
1948 and 1974. Her record was contested by Mohammad Rafi, who was claimed to have 
sung around 28,000 songs.[187][188] After Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, 
the Guinness Book of World Records stated her name for the "Most Recordings", 
but also stated Rafi's claim. The later editions of Guinness Book stated that 
she had sung no fewer than 30,000 songs between 1948 and 1987.[189]

The entry was discontinued by Guinness editions in 1991 without explanation, 
while several sources continued to claim that she recorded thousands of songs,
 with estimates ranging up to figures as large as 50,000.[190][191] However, even 
 the earliest Guinness claim of 25,000 songs (between 1948 and 1974) was disputed and
  claimed to have been exaggerated by several others, stating that the number of songs 
   by her in Hindi films till 1991 was found to be 5025.[192][193][194][195] Mangeshkar 
   stated that she did not keep a record of the number of songs she recorded, and that 
   she did not know from where Guinness Book editors got their information.[196] In 2011, 
   the entry was revived by Guinness crediting the record to her sister Asha Bhosle as 
   the most recorded artist in music history, "for recording up to 11,000 solo, duet and 
   chorus-backed songs and in over 20 Indian languages since 1947".[197] Since 2016, current 
   record in this category belongs to P. Susheela, for recording at
 least 17,695 songs in 6 languages, not counting some lost early recordings.[198]
